Godot 4.5 dev5 exported HTML web game crashes in itch.io embed on mobile browser when using audio.

I created this simple demo game with buttons that play sounds. The buttons also get pressed automatically in order to keep playing sound.

Game crashes/reloads after 1-3 mins

Tested on iOS Chrome and Safari

I also replicated this same demo game in Godot 3.5.3. The exported HTML web game embedded on itch.io seems to run with no issues:

Note: I also tried exporting with Godot 4.4.1 and it seems to have the same issue with the web game's audio on mobile browser.
